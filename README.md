Interactive Stock Dashboard

Developed a dynamic stock dashboard using Streamlit to analyze historical stock performance and retrieve financial metrics and news for any given stock ticker.
Integrated yFinance API to allow users to fetch and visualize stock data, including adjusted close prices over custom date ranges, utilizing Plotly for interactive data visualization.
Implemented tabs for Pricing Data, Fundamental Data, and Top 10 News, offering a comprehensive view of a company's performance, including key financial ratios and metrics such as Earnings Per Share (EPS), Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), and Return on Equity (ROE).
Added functionality to calculate and display annual returns, standard deviation, and risk-adjusted return, demonstrating proficiency in financial analysis and data manipulation using Pandas and Numpy.
Integrated the StockNews API to pull the latest news headlines and sentiment analysis for the selected stock, providing users with a real-time snapshot of market sentiment.
Built robust error handling mechanisms to ensure the dashboard remains user-friendly and informative even when encountering data retrieval issues.
