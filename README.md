This was a personal project to showcase my skills


Developed a dynamic stock market dashboard using Python and Streamlit, allowing users to visualize and analyze stock market data interactively. The dashboard integrates real-time financial data and news, providing a comprehensive tool for investors and analysts. 
Utilized Plotly Express for data visualiazion to create interactive line charts showing historical stock price movements. Used NumPy to implement calculations for annual returns, standard deviation, and risk-adjusted returns, providing insights into stock performance for financial analysis.
Displayed Fundamental Data by extracting and displaying key financial metrics (e.g., EPS, P/E ratio, Revenue Growth) using Yahoo Finance API, aiding in fundamental analysis.
Integrated StockNews API to fetch and analyze the sentiment of the latest news articles related to the selected stock, providing users with relevant information to make informed decisions.
Used pandas easier data manipulation.
